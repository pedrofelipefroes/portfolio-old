Avenue Code started off as an IT consultancy company, with much of its branding being underdeveloped. As the company grew, its first brand guide was designed in 2017 to provide a framework for business development personnel and marketers alike.

Two years later, Avenue Code further expansion led it to a global playground, and its brand felt limited in its new market context. A rebranding was planned to translate the company's diverse set of solutions and consultants, a process which started off by framing the challenge:

### How Might We redesign Avenue Code brand to become more scalable yet cohesive to the company’s spirit?

A four-stage process ensued, keeping scalability and cohesiveness as defining factors for the new brand identity.

#### Design Process—Stage 1

## Inspiration

The solution started-off by mapping Avenue Code current and ideal brand identities. Pain points from the previous branding were identified, as well as possibilities for expansion: taking the street art inspiration further and reflecting the company’s growth were one of the defined goals for the new branding.

      <Img alt={props.img.alt(3)} fluid={props.img.src(3)} />
    </>
  }
/>

#### Design Process—Stage 2

## Ideation

Creating mood boards & exploring colours, type, and themes within the established goals were the main action points in the second stage. Eight new base colours arose—a standout among other monochromatic tech companies—and each of them was named and associated with a value.

Having as many as 8 base colors was paramount to translate the company's growth over the years: Avenue Code' solutions gamut increased from 6 to 22, and the company hit the 500 employees mark in 2019 with 5 offices around the globe. This new colourful spectrum reflects how diverse its teams have become.

      </Fade>
    </>
  }
/>

While the Avenue Code logo was kept intact due to strategic reasons, the brand typeface changed to Overpass. Inspired by highway signage, this open-source typography effort possesses a curved-edge lettering, which can translate our playful and professional voice.

Urban-themed art became an inspiration to create textures and patterns, being the motif of our documents, presentations, and products. Crosswalk and subway-inspired artworks were designed as the first two brand themes to be further escalated on.

      <Img alt={props.img.alt(7)} fluid={props.img.src(7)} />
    </>
  }
/>

#### Design Process—Stage 3

## Implementation

The next stage of the rebranding consisted in documenting the newly-defined colors, typography, and primary themes. After developing a throughout Sketch library, slide deck guidelines were designed, with a new brand guide presentation built upon them.

  images={[

    <Img alt={props.img.alt(9)} fluid={props.img.src(9)} />,
    <Img alt={props.img.alt(10)} fluid={props.img.src(10)} />,
  ]}
/>

In lieu of the scalability goal, the brand themes were further escalated to the physical medium in the form of notepads, lanyards, promotional items, and even office artwork. It was important that the Avenue Code brand was well-perceived not just online, but in person as well.

    <Img alt={props.img.alt(12)} fluid={props.img.src(12)} />,
    <Img alt={props.img.alt(13)} fluid={props.img.src(13)} />,
    <Img alt={props.img.alt(14)} fluid={props.img.src(14)} />,
  ]}
/>

A rebranding campaign was developed to present the new brand to Avenue Code employees. Videos and activities about each value were released through the course of 8 weeks, each featuring a value and it's associated color.

        <source src={brandSystem} type="video/mp4" />
      </video>
    </>
  }
/>

One of the campaign's highlights was it's opening activity, where employees were encouraged to gift each other with cards featuring all eight brand values. It happened simultaneously around all 5 Avenue Code offices, with the possibility of sending each other online cards as well.

  }
/>

A redesign of the company's external channel started in late 2019, with its completion planned to mid 2020.

#### Design Process—Stage 4

## Inspection

A brand identity survey is planned to validate how the new Avenue Code brand resonates both internally and externally. The survey's goal is to improve brand awareness and understand its strengths in order to better plan the next branding efforts. The survey is planned to go live in 2020.
