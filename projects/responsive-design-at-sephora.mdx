Responsiveness is a design pattern in which combined layout elements adapt according to one’s screen size, providing the same level of user experience across every device.

Responsive design, however, can be quite challenging to implement across a shipped product, since the transition process requires time and effort from multiple teams.

Sephora’s engineering team faced this challenge in early 2019. Despite responsiveness clear benefits, justifying its implementation for a leadership board can be demanding.

To give grounds for such investment, I was tasked by Sephora’s Director of Front-end Engineering to conduct UX research to raise awareness & gather data around the matter.

I started the research by framing it as a design challenge:

### How might we justify the transition to responsive web design at Sephora.com for the company's leadership board?

Since the desired impact was to bring awareness and data for Sephora’s leadership, I wanted to design an easy-to-digest deck with responsiveness concepts and findings.

To better structure the creation of this presentation deck, I divided the research process into 3 different stages, starting with Inspiration.

## _Stage 01_ Inspiration

Before moving to actual research, it was important to map which kind of data would provide insight for Sephora’s leadership on transitioning to responsive design.

As they wouldn’t necessarily have any awareness around responsiveness, we started to frame questions that would be relevant for the leadership board around the subject.

After narrowing down our brainstorm questions, we were able to group them into 3 categories: basic concepts, industry analysis, and transitioning to responsiveness.

Mapping these questions was essential to provide an outline for the presentation deck as well as guide the next research steps, which started by gathering data around the subject.

## _Stage 02_ Ideation

Before talking about transitioning to responsive design, the leadership needed to understand what it is, its pros & cons, and other design patterns available.

Data was gathered around the 3 main design patterns—Responsive Design, Dynamic Serving, and especially Separate URLs, since it was Sephora’s current pattern.

While Separate URLs serve speedy web pages, it is also harder to maintain in the long run, and it impacts Sephora negatively due to the direct effect design patterns have on SEO.

As Google favors search results for pages compliant to their best practices (which include responsiveness), it was vital to benchmark Sephora’s performance amongst other retailers.

The performance from strategic web pages from these retailers was measured on [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) and compared with Sephora’s via a spreadsheet developed by me.

After gathering data from responsiveness concepts and retailers performance, it was time to understand what it’d take for Sephora to make the transition to responsive design.

Going full responsive takes effort from different areas—design, front-end, SEO, and product—so it’s important devising a well-rounded plan before making the switch.

From research discoveries and synchronization with other teams, we were able to develop a tentative timeline to implement responsiveness on a step-by-step basis.

## _Stage 03_ Implementation

Rounding up the research stage led to the creation of an on-brand deck to present responsive design findings and transition insights for Sephora’s leadership.

Research findings were summed up and simplified, and I designed visuals to make data easier to digest in the presentation.

<Media caption="Sephora’s branding template was used to craft a presentation deck to display the UX research findings. Data are blurred due to NDA.">
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(7)} fluid={props.media.src(7)} />

>
  <img alt={props.media.desc(8)} src={props.media.src(8)} />
  <img alt={props.media.desc(9)} src={props.media.src(9)} />
</Media>

The spreadsheet used to store research data was transformed into a dashboard and served as a companion piece for the presentation.

Through the new dashboard toggles and formulas, it was possible to compare Sephora’s statuses against all retailers or just one of them if they wanted to.

<Media caption="Caption: The dashboard was meant to help with data visualization and to provide a deeper look at the research findings. Data are blurred due to NDA.">
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(10)} fluid={props.media.src(10)} />
</Media>

Finally, we were able to draw key insights and present them in the last portion of the presentation.

For instance, transitioning to responsive design represented an opportunity to enhance code quality, improve performance, and consequentially the customer user experience.

And tying this with the positive SEO impact and the reduced maintenance required by responsiveness meant it would allow for overall cost savings too.

In the end, the research filled its role as an essential piece to provide awareness and strategy for Sephora's leadership on transitioning to a better, responsive experience.
