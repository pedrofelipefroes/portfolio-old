<!-- Avenue Code started in 2008 as a software development consultancy. As it grew, so did its solutions offerings, and further expansion led to the opening of more offices in the US, Brazil, Canada, and Europe in 2019.

Growth, however, brought a cultural diversity that its brand failed to represent. Our team was tasked to rebrand the company within its new market context but keeping its original spirit intact.

We began our task by framing our challenge:

### How might we redesign Avenue Code brand to become more scalable yet cohesive to the company spirit?

Since scalability and cohesiveness were seen as defining factors for the new brand, we wanted to create a brand system rather than just a collection of brand assets.

We also wanted to roll it our first internally, then externally, and to collect user opinions as well. Finally, we decided to divide our solution into 3 stages, starting with an Inspiration stage.

## _Stage 01_ Inspiration

We began our process by mapping out Avenue Code then-current brand identity to identify pain points and possibilities of growth.

Excerpt from the previous brand:

  numberOfItems={"2-4"}

  <Img alt={props.media.desc(2)} fluid={props.media.src(2)} />
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(3)} fluid={props.media.src(3)} />
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(4)} fluid={props.media.src(4)} />
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(5)} fluid={props.media.src(5)} />
</Media>

The urban inspiration for Avenue Code's name and logo was explored as well. We wanted to include it into the rebranding alongside the values that built the company spirit over the years.

By mapping out the company history, brand, and values, we were left with enough inspiration and direction to lead us to the next stage of the solution: Ideation.

## _Stage 02_ Ideation

Eight new base colors arose through color, typeface, and theme exploration—a strategic standout among other monochromatic IT companies. Each color was named and associated with a value.

Colors were drawn from a mood board of urban imagery over the 4 quadrants below and then normalized through the [HSLuv](https://www.hsluv.org/) color tool.

<Media caption="Having as many as 8 base colors also reflected the company growth over the years: moving from 6 to 22 solutions, hitting the 450 consultants mark, and opening 7 offices around the globe.">
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(6)} fluid={props.media.src(6)} />

      fluid={props.media.src(7)}
      className="p-rebranding-avenue-code__mood-board-overlay"
    />
  </Fade>
</Media>

Urban inspiration also helped define our typeface as well. Overpass, an open-source type, was selected as the base font family due to its bold edges and inspiration over US highway signage.

We went further and chose to use urban art as the motif of our brand system. Crosswalk and subway-inspired artworks were then designed as the first two themes to be further escalated on.

    <source src={props.media.src(12)} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Media>

Finally, while changing the logo wasn’t an option due to strategic reasons, we opted to animate it to include our base colors subtly.

With colors, type, themes, and logo properly defined, it was time to document these tokens and to start escalating the system as the rebranding reached its third stage, Implementation.

## _Stage 03_ Implementation

A Sketch library was developed based on our new brand tokens, and a brand guide deck was created to help understanding how the new brand was crafted, and how to properly use it.

<Carousel caption="Documentation for color shades, typography hierarchy, logo usage, and the company's values are some of the things available in the Sketch library and the brand guide.">
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(13)} fluid={props.media.src(13)} />
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(14)} fluid={props.media.src(14)} />
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(15)} fluid={props.media.src(15)} />
</Carousel>

Presentation themes and redesigned email layouts were also developed. They needed to follow similar patterns and thematics, as we wanted to create a cohesive brand system.

The brand themes were escalated to notepads, lanyards, promotional items, and office artwork. The Avenue Code brand needed to be well-perceived not just online, but in person as well.

A marketing campaign helped present the new brand internally. Weekly activities were themed after each color and value, with each promotional item being released as companion pieces.

<Carousel size="XL">
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(16)} fluid={props.media.src(16)} />
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(17)} fluid={props.media.src(17)} />
  <Img alt={props.media.desc(18)} fluid={props.media.src(18)} />
</Carousel>

We wanted to educate the consultants on why branding, design systems, and each one of the values mattered—so we recorded videos to be rolled out weekly as well.

<Media

  <video controls poster={props.media.src(19)} width="100%">
    <source src={props.media.src(20)} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
  <video controls poster={props.media.src(21)} width="100%">
    <source src={props.media.src(22)} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Media>

The campaign kicked off with a global opening activity where employees were encouraged to gift each other cards featuring all 8 brand values, with the possibility of sending online cards as well.

<Media>
  <video controls poster={props.media.src(23)} width="100%">
    <source src={props.media.src(24)} type="video/mp4" />
  </video>
</Media>

Meanwhile, a redesign of the Avenue Code external channels started in late 2019, with its completion planned to late 2020 with a redesigned company website.

Finally, to validate how the new Avenue Code brand resonates both internally and externally, a brand identity survey is planned to roll out during 2020.

The survey goal is to improve brand awareness and to understand its strengths and opportunities to better plan Avenue Code next branding efforts.
